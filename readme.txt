DONKEY KONG

AIM:
TO SAVE THE PRINCESS BY CLIMBING PLATFORMS USING LADDERS.DODGING ONE SELF FROM THE INCOMING FIREBALLS THAT MOVE RANDOMLY.
ALSO TRY TO COLLECT AS MANY COINS AS POSSIBLE THAT WILL ALSO BE GENERATED RANDOMLY.YOU HAVE 3 LIVES TO COMPLETE BOTH THE LEVELS.
ALL THE BEST!!

CONTROLS:
RIGHT-ARROW : MOVE RIGHT
LEFT-ARROW : MOVE LEFT
UP-ARROW : MOVE UP(ONLY WHEN LADDER PRESENT)
DOWN-ARROW : MOVE DOWN(ONLY WHEN LADDER PRESENT)
SPACE-BAR: JUMP(DEFAULT DIRECTION FORWARD)
SPACE-BAR + ARROW(RIGHT AND LEFT):JUMP IN SPECIFIED DIRECTION

LEVELS:
LEVEL 1:MULTIPLE LADDERS ON PLATFORMS.SLOWER RATE OF FIREBALLS

NO OF LIVES:3

LEVEL2:
BROKEN LADDERS PRESENT.
LESS NO OF LADDERS
MUCH HIGHER FREQUENCY OF FIREBALLS

VISUALIZATION:
ORANGE BLOCKS OR FIREBALLS
YELLOW CROWN - PRINCESS

THE GAME IS MAINLY QUITE SIMILAR TO ORIGINAL DONKEY KONG.THE FIREBALLS APART FROM FALLING DOWN PLATFORMS AND LADDERS ALSO FALL DOWN RANDOMLY BASED ON A RANDOM DIRECTION VALUE.COINS ARE GENERATED AT RANDOM POSITIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.FIREBALLS CHOOSE THEIR MOVING DIRECTION RANDOMLY AND CHANGE THEIR MOVING DIRECTION PEIODICALLY.THEY FALL IF IN AIR.PLAYER CAN GO UP AND DOWN LADDERS(NOT BROKEN ONES).THE PRINCESS IS AT THE TOPMOST LEVEL.ONE HAS 3 LIVES TO COMPLETE TASK.DIRECTIONAL JUMPING IS INCLUDED.ALSO THE KONG ALSO MOVES RANDOMLY ON THE HIGHEST PALTFORM.ONE CAN PROCEED TO LEVEL-2 ONLY WHEN HE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES LEVEL-1

SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT:
WHILE CHANGING LEVELS U ARE PROMPTED FOR A 'l' KEY PRESS.THIS TAKES SOME MULTIPLE PRESSING TO ADVANCE TO NEXT LEVEL(NO IDEA WHY)
